## 📖 Overview
The **Fallout 4 Perk Planner (FPP)** is a Python-based desktop application that lets players design and visualize their custom perk progression from Level 2 to 50 — and beyond.  
It uses a **Tkinter GUI** to load perk data from a JSON file (`perks_flattened_full.json`) and allows users to generate, save, and preview personalized perk plans.

This project was developed to commemorate **10 years of Fallout 4** (2015 – 2025) and to give fans a nostalgic yet modern way to strategize their builds.
